import Icon from "@site/src/components/icon";

This flow extends the [basic prompting flow](/starter-projects-basic-prompting) with a **Chat memory** component that stores up to 100 previous chat messages and uses them to provide context for the current conversation.

## Prerequisites

- [Langflow installed and running](/get-started-installation)
- [OpenAI API key created](https://platform.openai.com/)

## Create the memory chatbot flow

1. From the Langflow dashboard, click **New Flow**.
2. Select **Memory Chatbot**.
3. The **Memory Chatbot** flow is created.

This flow adds a **Chat Memory** component to the Basic Prompting flow. This component retrieves previous messages and sends them to the **Prompt** component to fill a part of the **Template** with context.

To examine the template, clicking the **Template** field in the **Prompt** component.
The **Prompt** tells the **OpenAI model** component how to respond to input.

```plain
You are a helpful assistant that answers questions.

Use markdown to format your answer, properly embedding images and urls.

History:

{memory}
```

The `{memory}` code in the prompt creates a new input port in the component called **memory**.
The **Chat Memory** component is connected to this port to store chat messages from the **Playground**.

This gives the **OpenAI** component a memory of previous chat messages.

## Run the memory chatbot flow

1. Open the **Playground**.
2. Type multiple questions. 
Click <Icon name="Ellipsis" aria-label="Horizontal ellipsis" /> to see additional options for a component.

your queries are logged in order. Up to 100 queries are stored by default. Try telling the AI your name and asking `What is my name?` in a second message, or `What is the first subject I asked you about?` to validate that previous knowledge is taking effect.


## Use Session ID with the memory chatbot flow

`SessionID` is a unique identifier in Langflow that stores conversation sessions between the AI and a user. A `SessionID` is created when a conversation is initiated, and then associated with all subsequent messages during that session.

In the **Memory Chatbot** flow you created, the **Chat Memory** component references past interactions by **Session ID**. You can demonstrate this by modifying the **Session ID** value to switch between conversation histories.

1. In the **Session ID** field of the **Chat Memory** and **Chat Input** components, add a **Session ID** value like `MySessionID`.
2. Now, once you send a new message the **Playground**, you should have a new memory created on the **Memories** tab.
3. Notice how your conversation is being stored in different memory sessions.
